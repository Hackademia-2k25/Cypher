Electromagnetic radiation belonging to this region of the\\nspectrum (wavelength of about 400 nm to 750 nm) is called light. It is\\nmainly through light and the sense of vision that we know and interpret\\nthe world around us.\\nThere are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from\\ncommon experience. First, that it travels with enormous speed and second,\\nthat it travels in a straight line. It took some time for people to realise that\\nthe speed of light is finite and measurable. Its presently accepted value\\nin vacuum is c = 2.99792458 × 108 m s–1.  For many purposes, it suffices\\nto take c = 3 × 10 8 m s–1 . The speed of light in vacuum is the highest\\nspeed attainable in nature.\\nThe intuitive notion that light travels in a straight line seems to\\ncontradict what we have learnt in Chapter 8, that light is an\\nelectromagnetic wave of wavelength belonging to the visible part of the\\nspectrum. How to reconcile the two facts? The answer is that the\\nwavelength of light is very small compared to the size of ordinary objects\\nthat we encounter commonly (generally of the order of a few cm or larger).\\nIn this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be\\nconsidered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joining\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

The path is called a ray of light, and a bundle of such rays\\nconstitutes a beam of light.\\nIn this chapter, we consider the phenomena of reflection, refraction\\nand dispersion of light, using the ray picture of light. Using the basic\\nlaws of reflection and refraction, we shall study the image formation by\\nplane and spherical reflecting and refracting surfaces. We then go on to\\ndescribe the construction and working of some important optical\\ninstruments, including the human eye.\\n9.2  REFLECTION OF LIGHT BY SPHERICAL MIRRORS\\nWe are familiar with the laws of r eflection. The\\nangle of reflection (i.e., the angle between reflected\\nray and the normal to the reflecting surface or\\nthe mirror) equals the angle of incidence (angle\\nbetween incident ray and the normal). Also that\\nthe incident ray, reflected ray and the normal to\\nthe reflecting surface at the point of incidence lie\\nin the same plane (Fig. 9.1). These laws are valid\\nat each point on any reflecting surface whether\\nplane or curved. However, we shall r estrict our\\ndiscussion to the special case of curved surfaces,\\nthat is, spherical surfaces. The normal in this case\\nis to be taken as normal to the tangent to surface\\nat the point of incidence. That is, the normal is\\nalong the radius, the line joining the centre of curvature of the mirror to\\nthe point of incidence.\\nWe have already studied that the geometric centre of a spherical mirror\\nis called its pole while that of a spherical lens is called its optical centre.\\nThe line joining the pole and the centre of curvature of the spherical\\nmirror is known as the principal axis. In the case of spherical lenses, the\\nprincipal axis is the line joining the optical centre with its principal focus\\nas you will see later.\\n9.2.1  Sign convention\\nTo derive the relevant formulae for\\nreflection by spherical mirrors and\\nrefraction by spherical lenses, we must\\nfirst adopt a sign convention for\\nmeasuring distances. In this book, we\\nshall follow the Cartesian sign\\nconvention . According to this\\nconvention, all distances are measured\\nfrom the pole of the mirror or the optical\\ncentre of the lens. The distances\\nmeasured in the same direction as the\\nincident light are taken as positive and\\nthose measured in the direction\\nopposite to the direction of incident light are taken as negative (Fig. 9.2).\\nThe heights measured upwards with respect to x-axis and normal to the\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

We assume that the rays\\nare paraxial, i.e., they are incident at points close to the pole P of the mirror\\nand make small angles with the principal axis. The reflected rays converge\\nat a point F on the principal axis of a concave mirror [Fig. 9.3(a)].\\nFor a convex mirror, the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point F\\non its principal axis [Fig. 9.3(b)]. The point F is called the principal focus\\nof the mirror. If the parallel paraxial beam of light were incident, making\\nsome angle with the principal axis, the reflected rays would converge (or\\nappear to diverge) from a point in a plane through F normal to the principal\\naxis. This is called the focal plane of the mirror [Fig. 9.3(c)].\\nFIGURE 9.3  Focus of a concave and convex mirr or.\\nThe distance between the focus F and the pole P of the mirror is called\\nthe focal length of the mirror, denoted by f. We now show that f = R/2,\\nwhere R is the radius of curvature of the mirror. The geometry of reflection\\nof an incident ray is shown in Fig. 9.4.\\nLet C be the centre of curvature of the mirror. Consider a ray parallel\\nto the principal axis striking the mirror at M. Then CM will be\\nperpendicular to the mirror at M. Let \\nq be the angle of incidence, and MD\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

(9.1) gives\\nMD\\nFD  = 2 \\nMD\\nCD\\nor, FD = \\nCD\\n2 (9.2)\\nNow, for small q, the point D is very close to the point P.\\nTherefore, FD = f and CD = R. Equation (9.2) then gives\\nf = R/2 (9.3)\\n9.2.3  The mirror equation\\nIf rays emanating from a point actually meet at another point\\nafter reflection and/or refraction, that point is called the image\\nof the first point. The image is real if the rays actually converge\\nto the point; it is virtual if the rays do not actually meet but\\nappear to diverge from the point when produced\\nbackwards. An image is thus a point-to-point\\ncorrespondence with the object established through\\nreflection and/or refraction.\\nIn principle, we can take any two rays emanating\\nfrom a point on an object, trace their paths, find their\\npoint of intersection and thus, obtain the image of\\nthe point due to reflection at a spherical mirror. In\\npractice, however, it is convenient to choose any two\\nof the following rays:\\n(i)The ray from the point which is parallel to the\\nprincipal axis. The reflected ray goes through\\nthe focus of the mirror.\\n(ii) The ray passing through the centre of\\ncurvature of a concave mirror or appearing to\\npass through it for a convex mirr or. The\\nreflected ray simply retraces the path.\\n(iii) The ray passing through (or directed towards) the focus of the concave\\nmirror or appearing to pass through (or directed towards) the focus\\nof a convex mirror. The reflected ray is parallel to the principal axis.\\n(iv) The ray incident at any angle at the pole. The reflected ray follows\\nlaws of reflection.\\nFigure 9.5 shows the ray diagram considering three rays. It shows\\nthe image A¢B¢ (in this case, real) of an object AB formed by a concave\\nmirror. It does not mean that only three rays emanate from the point A.\\nAn infinite number of rays emanate from any source, in all directions.\\nThus, point A¢ is image point of A if every ray originating at point A and\\nfalling on the concave mirror after reflection passes through the point A¢.\\nFIGURE 9.4 Geometry of\\nreflection of an incident ray on\\n(a) concave spherical mirr or,\\nand (b) convex spherical mirr or.\\nFIGURE 9.5 Ray diagram for image\\nformation by a concave mirr or.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

We now\\napply the sign convention. We note that light travels from the object to\\nthe mirror MPN. Hence this is taken as the positive direction. To reach\\nthe object AB, image A¢B¢ as well as the focus F from the pole P, we have\\nto travel opposite to the direction of incident light. Hence, all the three\\nwill have negative signs.

A ray of light represents a beam. The direction of propagation of an\\nobliquely incident (0°< i < 90°) ray of light that enters the other medium,\\nchanges at the interface of the two media. This phenomenon is called\\nrefraction of light . Snell experimentally obtained the following laws\\nof refraction:\\n(i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the\\nnormal to the interface at the point of\\nincidence, all lie in the same plane.\\n(ii) The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence\\nto the sine of angle of refraction is constant.\\nRemember that the angles of incidence (i ) and\\nrefraction (r ) are the angles that the incident\\nand  its refracted ray make with the normal,\\nrespectively. We have\\n21\\nsin\\nsin\\ni nr = (9.10)\\nwhere n21 is a constant, called the refractive\\nindex of the second medium with respect to the\\nfirst medium. Equation (9.10) is the well-known\\nSnell’s law of r efraction. We note that n21 is a\\ncharacteristic of the pair of media (and also depends on the wavelength\\nof light), but is independent of the angle of incidence.\\nFrom Eq. (9.10), if n21 > 1, r < i, i.e., the refracted ray bends towards\\nthe normal. In such a case medium 2 is said to be optically denser (or\\ndenser, in short) than medium 1. On the other hand, if n21 <1, r > i, the\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

This\\nis the case when incident ray in a denser\\nmedium refracts into a rarer medium.\\nNote:  Optical density should not be\\nconfused with mass density, which is mass\\nper unit volume. It is possible that mass\\ndensity of an optically denser medium may\\nbe less than that of an optically rarer\\nmedium (optical density is the ratio of the\\nspeed of light in two media). For example,\\nturpentine and water . Mass density of\\nturpentine is less than that of water but\\nits optical density is higher.\\nIf n21 is the refractive index of medium 2 with\\nrespect to medium 1 and n12 the refractive index\\nof medium 1 with respect to medium 2, then it\\nshould be clear that\\n12\\n21\\n1n n= (9.11)\\nIt also follows that if n32 is the refractive index\\nof medium 3 with respect to medium 2 then  n32 =\\nn31 ×  n12, where  n31 is the refractive index  of\\nmedium 3 with respect to medium 1.\\nSome elementary results based on the laws of\\nrefraction follow immediately. For a rectangular\\nslab, refraction takes place at two interfaces (air-\\nglass and glass-air). It is easily seen from Fig. 9.9\\nthat r2 = i1, i.e., the emergent ray is parallel to the\\nincident ray—there is no deviation, but it does\\nsuffer lateral displacement/shift with respect to the\\nincident ray. Another familiar observation is that\\nthe bottom of a tank filled with water appears to be\\nraised (Fig. 9.10). For viewing near the normal direction, it can be shown\\nthat the apparent depth (h1) is real depth (h2) divided by the refractive\\nindex of the medium (water).\\n9.4  TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION\\nWhen light travels from an optically denser medium to a rarer medium\\nat the interface, it is partly reflected back into the same medium and\\npartly refracted to the second medium. This reflection is called the internal\\nreflection.\\nWhen a ray of light enters from a denser medium to a rarer medium,\\nit bends away from the normal, for example, the ray AO1 B in Fig. 9.11.\\nThe incident ray AO1 is partially reflected (O1C) and partially transmitted\\n(O1B) or refracted, the angle of refraction (r) being larger than the angle of\\nincidence (i). As the angle of incidence increases, so does the angle of\\nFIGURE 9.10  Apparent depth for\\n(a) normal, and (b) oblique viewing.\\nFIGURE 9.9  Lateral shift of a ray refracted\\nthrough a parallel-sided slab.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

The refracted ray is bent\\nso much away from the normal that it\\ngrazes the surface at the interface between\\nthe two media. This is shown by the ray\\nAO3 D in Fig. 9.11. If the angle of incidence\\nis increased still further (e.g., the ray AO4),\\nrefraction is not possible, and the incident\\nray is totally reflected. This is called total\\ninter nal r eflection . When light gets\\nreflected by a surface, normally some\\nfraction of it gets transmitted. The\\nreflected ray, therefore, is always less\\nintense than the incident ray, howsoever\\nsmooth the reflecting surface may be. In\\ntotal internal reflection, on the other hand,\\nno transmission of light takes place.\\nThe angle of incidence corresponding to an angle of refraction 90°,\\nsay ÐAO3N, is called the critical angle (ic ) for the given pair of media.   We\\nsee from Snell’s law [Eq. (9.10)] that if the relative refractive index of the\\nrefracting medium is less than one then, since the maximum value of sin\\nr is unity, there is an upper limit to the value of sin i for which the law\\ncan be satisfied, that is, i = ic such that\\nsin ic  = n21 (9.12)\\nFor values of  i larger than ic, Snell’s law of refraction cannot be\\nsatisfied, and hence no refraction is possible.\\nThe refractive index of denser medium 1 with respect to rarer medium\\n2 will be n12 = 1/sinic. Some typical critical angles are listed in Table 9.1.\\nFIGURE 9.11   Refraction and internal reflection\\nof rays from a point A in the denser medium\\n(water) incident at different angles at the interface\\nwith a rarer medium (air).\\nA demonstration for total inter nal reflection\\nAll optical phenomena can be demonstrated very easily with the use of a\\nlaser torch or pointer, which is easily available nowadays.

Take\\na laser pointer and shine its beam thr ough the turbid water.

Do you find that it undergoes partial\\nreflection (which is seen as a spot on the table below) and partial refraction\\n[which comes out in the air and is seen as a spot on the roof; Fig. 9.12(a)]?\\nNow direct the laser beam from one side of the beaker such that it strikes\\nthe upper surface of water more obliquely [Fig. 9.12(b)]. Adjust the\\ndirection of laser beam until you find the angle for which the refraction\\nabove the water surface is totally absent and the beam is totally reflected\\nback to water.

Such a prism is also\\nused to invert images without chxanging their size [Fig. 9.13(c)].\\nIn the first two cases, the critical angle ic for the material of the prism\\nmust be less than 45°. We see from Table 9.1 that this is true for both\\ncrown glass and dense flint glass.\\n(ii) Optical fibres : Nowadays optical fibres are extensively used for\\ntransmitting audio and video signals through long distances. Optical\\nfibres too make use of the phenomenon of total internal reflection.\\nOptical fibres are fabricated with high quality composite glass/quartz\\nfibres. Each fibre consists of a core and\\ncladding. The refractive index of the\\nmaterial of the core is higher than that\\nof the cladding.\\nWhen a signal in the form of light is\\ndirected at one end of the fibre at a suitable\\nangle, it undergoes repeated total internal\\nreflections along the length of the fibre and\\nfinally comes out at the other end (Fig.\\n9.14). Since light undergoes total internal\\nreflection at each stage, there is no\\nappreciable loss in the intensity of the light\\nsignal. Optical fibres are fabricated such\\nthat light reflected at one side of inner\\nsurface strikes the other at an angle larger\\nthan the critical angle. Even if the fibre is\\nbent, light can easily travel along its length.\\nThus, an optical fibre can be used to act as\\nan optical pipe.\\nA bundle of optical fibres can be put to\\nseveral uses.

Obviously, optical\\nfibres can also be used for transmission of\\noptical signals. For example, these are used\\nas a ‘light pipe’ to facilitate visual examination\\nof internal organs like esophagus, stomach\\nand intestines. You might have seen a\\ncommonly available decorative lamp with fine\\nplastic fibres with their free ends forming a\\nfountain like structure. The other end of the\\nfibres is fixed over an electric lamp. When the\\nlamp is switched on, the light travels from the bottom of each fibre and\\nappears at the tip of its free end as a dot of light. The fibres in such\\ndecorative lamps are optical fibres.\\nThe main requirement in fabricating optical fibres is that there should\\nbe very little absorption of light as it travels for long distances inside\\nthem. This has been achieved by purification and special preparation of\\nmaterials such as quartz. In silica glass fibres, it is possible to transmit\\nmore than 95% of the light over a fibre length of 1 km.

We shall now\\nconsider refraction at a spherical interface between two transparent media.\\nAn infinitesimal part of a spherical surface can be regarded as planar\\nand the same laws of refraction can be applied at every point on the\\nsurface. Just as for reflection by a spherical mirror, the normal at the\\npoint of incidence is perpendicular to the tangent plane to the spherical\\nsurface at that point and, therefore, passes through its centre of\\ncurvature. We first consider refraction by a single spherical surface and\\nfollow it by thin lenses. A thin lens is a transparent optical medium\\nbounded by two surfaces; at least one of which should be spherical.\\nApplying the formula for image formation by a single spherical surface\\nsuccessively at the two surfaces of a lens, we shall obtain the lens maker’s\\nformula and then the lens formula.\\n9.5.1  Refraction at a spherical surface\\nFigure 9.15 shows the geometry of formation of image I of an object O on\\nthe principal axis of a spherical surface with centre of curvature C, and\\nradius of curvature R. The rays are incident from a medium of refractive\\nindex n1, to another of refractive index n2. As before, we take the aperture\\n(or the lateral size) of the surface to be small compared to other distances\\ninvolved, so that small angle approximation can be made. In particular,\\nNM will be taken to be nearly equal to the length of the perpendicular\\nfrom the point N on the principal axis.

The focus on the\\nside of the (original) source of light is called the first focal point, whereas\\nthe other is called the second focal point.\\nTo find the image of an object by a lens, we can, in principle, take any\\ntwo rays emanating from a point on an object; trace their paths using the\\nlaws of refraction and find the point where the refracted rays meet (or\\nappear to meet).

Clearly, a lens of shorter focal length bends the incident\\nlight more,  while converging it in case of a convex lens\\nand diverging it in case of a concave lens. The power P of\\na lens is defined as the tangent of the angle by which it\\nconverges or diverges a beam of light parallel to the\\nprincipal axis falling at unit distance from the optical\\ncentre (Fig. 9.18).\\ntan ; , tanδ δ= = =h\\nf h fif 1 1\\n or \\n1\\nfδ =  for small\\nvalue of d.

Power of a lens is positive\\nfor a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens. Thus, when an\\noptician prescribes a corrective lens of power + 2.5 D, the required lens is\\na convex lens of focal length + 40 cm.

Let the object\\nbe placed at a point O beyond the focus of the first\\nlens A (Fig. 9.19). The first lens produces an image\\nat I1. Since image I 1 is real, it serves as a virtual\\nobject for the second lens B, producing the final\\nimage at I. It must, however, be borne in mind that\\nformation of image by the first lens is presumed\\nonly to facilitate determination of the position of the\\nfinal image. In fact, the direction of rays emerging\\nfrom the first lens gets modified in accordance with\\nthe angle at which they strike the second lens.

In practice, it is difficult to make the focal length much smaller\\nthan 1 cm.

Refracting telescopes can be used both for\\nterrestrial and astronomical observations. For example, consider\\na telescope whose objective has a focal length of 100 cm and the eyepiece\\na focal length of 1 cm. The magnifying power of this telescope is\\nm = 100/1 = 100.\\nLet us consider a pair of stars of actual separation 1¢ (one minute of\\narc). The stars appear as though they are separated by an angle of 100 ×\\n1¢ = 100¢ =1.67°.\\nThe main considerations with an astronomical telescope are its light\\ngathering power and its resolution or resolving power. The former clearly\\ndepends on the area of the objective. With larger diameters, fainter objects\\ncan be observed. The r\\nesolving power, or the ability to observe two objects\\ndistinctly, which are in very nearly the same direction, also depends on\\nthe diameter of the objective. So, the desirable aim in optical telescopes is\\nto make them with objective of large diameter. The largest lens objective\\nin use has a diameter of 40 inch (~1.02 m). It is at the Yerkes Observatory\\nin Wisconsin, USA. Such big lenses tend to be very heavy and therefore,\\ndifficult to make and support by their edges. Further, it is rather difficult\\nand expensive to make such large sized lenses which form images that\\nare free from any kind of chromatic aberration and distortions.\\nFor these reasons, modern telescopes use a concave mirror rather\\nthan a lens for the objective.

Reflection is governed by the equation Ði = Ðr¢  and refraction by the\\nSnell’s law, sini/sinr = n, where the incident ray, reflected ray, refracted\\nray and normal lie in the same plane. Angles of incidence, reflection\\nand refraction are i, r ¢ and r, respectively.\\n2. The critical angle of incidence ic for a ray incident from a denser to rarer\\nmedium, is that angle for which the angle of refraction is 90°. For\\ni > ic, total internal reflection occurs. Multiple internal reflections in\\ndiamond (ic  @ 24.4°), totally reflecting prisms and mirage, are some\\nexamples of total internal reflection. Optical fibres consist of glass\\nfibres coated with a thin layer of material of lower refractive index.\\nLight incident at an angle at one end comes out at the other , after\\nmultiple internal reflections, even if the fibre is bent.\\nFIGURE 9.26  Schematic diagram of a reflecting telescope (Cassegrain).\\nthe telescope tube.

The laws of reflection and refraction are true for all surfaces and\\npairs of media at the point of the incidence.\\n2. The real image of an object placed between f and 2f from a convex lens\\ncan be seen on a screen placed at the image location. If the screen is\\nremoved, is the image still there?  This question puzzles many, because\\nit is difficult to reconcile ourselves with an image suspended in air\\nwithout a screen. But the image does exist. Rays from a given point\\non the object are converging to an image point in space and diverging\\naway. The screen simply diffuses these rays, some of which reach our\\neye and we see the image. This can be seen by the images formed in\\nair during a laser show.\\n3. Image formation needs regular reflection/refraction. In principle, all\\nrays from a given point should reach the same image point. This is\\nwhy you do not see your image by an irregular reflecting object, say\\nthe page of a book.\\n4. Thick lenses give coloured images due to dispersion. The variety in\\ncolour of objects we see around us is due to the constituent colours\\nof the light incident on them. A monochromatic light may produce an\\nentirely different perception about the colours on an object as seen in\\nwhite light.\\n5. For a simple microscope, the angular size of the object equals the\\nangular size of the image. Yet it offers magnification because we can\\nkeep the small object much closer to the eye than 25 cm and hence\\nhave it subtend a large angle. The image is at 25 cm which we can see.\\nWithout the microscope, you would need to keep the small object at\\n25 cm which would subtend a very small angle.\\n8. Magnifying power m of a simple microscope is given by m = 1 + (D/f),\\nwhere D = 25 cm is the least distance of distinct vision and f is the\\nfocal length of the convex lens. If the image is at infinity, m = D/f. For\\na compound microscope, the magnifying power is given by m = me × m0\\nwhere me = 1 + (D/fe), is the magnification due to the eyepiece and mo\\nis the magnification produced by the objective. Approximately,\\no e\\nL Dm f f= ×\\nwhere fo and fe are the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece,\\nrespectively, and L is the distance between their focal points.\\n9.

Electromagnetic radiation belonging to this region of the\\nspectrum (wavelength of about 400 nm to 750 nm) is called light. It is\\nmainly through light and the sense of vision that we know and interpret\\nthe world around us.\\nThere are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from\\ncommon experience. First, that it travels with enormous speed and second,\\nthat it travels in a straight line. It took some time for people to realise that\\nthe speed of light is finite and measurable. Its presently accepted value\\nin vacuum is c = 2.99792458 × 108 m s–1.  For many purposes, it suffices\\nto take c = 3 × 10 8 m s–1 . The speed of light in vacuum is the highest\\nspeed attainable in nature.\\nThe intuitive notion that light travels in a straight line seems to\\ncontradict what we have learnt in Chapter 8, that light is an\\nelectromagnetic wave of wavelength belonging to the visible part of the\\nspectrum. How to reconcile the two facts? The answer is that the\\nwavelength of light is very small compared to the size of ordinary objects\\nthat we encounter commonly (generally of the order of a few cm or larger).\\nIn this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be\\nconsidered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joining\\n2024-25'),\n",

The path is called a ray of light, and a bundle of such rays\\nconstitutes a beam of light.\\nIn this chapter, we consider the phenomena of reflection, refraction\\nand dispersion of light, using the ray picture of light. Using the basic\\nlaws of reflection and refraction, we shall study the image formation by\\nplane and spherical reflecting and refracting surfaces. We then go on to\\ndescribe the construction and working of some important optical\\ninstruments, including the human eye.\\n9.2  REFLECTION OF LIGHT BY SPHERICAL MIRRORS\\nWe are familiar with the laws of r eflection. The\\nangle of reflection (i.e., the angle between reflected\\nray and the normal to the reflecting surface or\\nthe mirror) equals the angle of incidence (angle\\nbetween incident ray and the normal). Also that\\nthe incident ray, reflected ray and the normal to\\nthe reflecting surface at the point of incidence lie\\nin the same plane (Fig. 9.1). These laws are valid\\nat each point on any reflecting surface whether\\nplane or curved. However, we shall r estrict our\\ndiscussion to the special case of curved surfaces,\\nthat is, spherical surfaces. The normal in this case\\nis to be taken as normal to the tangent to surface\\nat the point of incidence. That is, the normal is\\nalong the radius, the line joining the centre of curvature of the mirror to\\nthe point of incidence.\\nWe have already studied that the geometric centre of a spherical mirror\\nis called its pole while that of a spherical lens is called its optical centre.\\nThe line joining the pole and the centre of curvature of the spherical\\nmirror is known as the principal axis.

We assume that the rays\\nare paraxial, i.e., they are incident at points close to the pole P of the mirror\\nand make small angles with the principal axis. The reflected rays converge\\nat a point F on the principal axis of a concave mirror [Fig. 9.3(a)].\\nFor a convex mirror, the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point F\\non its principal axis [Fig. 9.3(b)]. The point F is called the principal focus\\nof the mirror. If the parallel paraxial beam of light were incident, making\\nsome angle with the principal axis, the reflected rays would converge (or\\nappear to diverge) from a point in a plane through F normal to the principal\\naxis. This is called the focal plane of the mirror [Fig. 9.3(c)].\\nFIGURE 9.3  Focus of a concave and convex mirr or.\\nThe distance between the focus F and the pole P of the mirror is called\\nthe focal length of the mirror, denoted by f.

The image is real if the rays actually converge\\nto the point; it is virtual if the rays do not actually meet but\\nappear to diverge from the point when produced\\nbackwards. An image is thus a point-to-point\\ncorrespondence with the object established through\\nreflection and/or refraction.\\nIn principle, we can take any two rays emanating\\nfrom a point on an object, trace their paths, find their\\npoint of intersection and thus, obtain the image of\\nthe point due to reflection at a spherical mirror. In\\npractice, however, it is convenient to choose any two\\nof the following rays:\\n(i)The ray from the point which is parallel to the\\nprincipal axis. The reflected ray goes through\\nthe focus of the mirror.\\n(ii) The ray passing through the centre of\\ncurvature of a concave mirror or appearing to\\npass through it for a convex mirr or. The\\nreflected ray simply retraces the path.\\n(iii) The ray passing through (or directed towards) the focus of the concave\\nmirror or appearing to pass through (or directed towards) the focus\\nof a convex mirror. The reflected ray is parallel to the principal axis.\\n(iv) The ray incident at any angle at the pole. The reflected ray follows\\nlaws of reflection.\\nFigure 9.5 shows the ray diagram considering three rays. It shows\\nthe image A¢B¢ (in this case, real) of an object AB formed by a concave\\nmirror. It does not mean that only three rays emanate from the point A.\\nAn infinite number of rays emanate from any source, in all directions.\\nThus, point A¢ is image point of A if every ray originating at point A and\\nfalling on the concave mirror after reflection passes through the point A¢.\\nFIGURE 9.4 Geometry of\\nreflection of an incident ray on\\n(a) concave spherical mirr or,\\nand (b) convex spherical mirr or.\\nFIGURE 9.5 Ray diagram for image\\nformation by a concave mirr or.\\n2024-25'),\n",

A ray of light represents a beam. The direction of propagation of an\\nobliquely incident (0°< i < 90°) ray of light that enters the other medium,\\nchanges at the interface of the two media. This phenomenon is called\\nrefraction of light . Snell experimentally obtained the following laws\\nof refraction:\\n(i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the\\nnormal to the interface at the point of\\nincidence, all lie in the same plane.\\n(ii) The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence\\nto the sine of angle of refraction is constant.\\nRemember that the angles of incidence (i ) and\\nrefraction (r ) are the angles that the incident\\nand  its refracted ray make with the normal,\\nrespectively. We have\\n21\\nsin\\nsin\\ni nr = (9.10)\\nwhere n21 is a constant, called the refractive\\nindex of the second medium with respect to the\\nfirst medium. Equation (9.10) is the well-known\\nSnell’s law of r efraction. We note that n21 is a\\ncharacteristic of the pair of media (and also depends on the wavelength\\nof light), but is independent of the angle of incidence.\\nFrom Eq. (9.10), if n21 > 1, r < i, i.e., the refracted ray bends towards\\nthe normal. In such a case medium 2 is said to be optically denser (or\\ndenser, in short) than medium 1.

This\\nis the case when incident ray in a denser\\nmedium refracts into a rarer medium.\\nNote:  Optical density should not be\\nconfused with mass density, which is mass\\nper unit volume. It is possible that mass\\ndensity of an optically denser medium may\\nbe less than that of an optically rarer\\nmedium (optical density is the ratio of the\\nspeed of light in two media). For example,\\nturpentine and water . Mass density of\\nturpentine is less than that of water but\\nits optical density is higher.\\nIf n21 is the refractive index of medium 2 with\\nrespect to medium 1 and n12 the refractive index\\nof medium 1 with respect to medium 2, then it\\nshould be clear that\\n12\\n21\\n1n n= (9.11)\\nIt also follows that if n32 is the refractive index\\nof medium 3 with respect to medium 2 then  n32 =\\nn31 ×  n12, where  n31 is the refractive index  of\\nmedium 3 with respect to medium 1.\\nSome elementary results based on the laws of\\nrefraction follow immediately. For a rectangular\\nslab, refraction takes place at two interfaces (air-\\nglass and glass-air). It is easily seen from Fig. 9.9\\nthat r2 = i1, i.e., the emergent ray is parallel to the\\nincident ray—there is no deviation, but it does\\nsuffer lateral displacement/shift with respect to the\\nincident ray. Another familiar observation is that\\nthe bottom of a tank filled with water appears to be\\nraised (Fig. 9.10). For viewing near the normal direction, it can be shown\\nthat the apparent depth (h1) is real depth (h2) divided by the refractive\\nindex of the medium (water).\\n9.4  TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION\\nWhen light travels from an optically denser medium to a rarer medium\\nat the interface, it is partly reflected back into the same medium and\\npartly refracted to the second medium. This reflection is called the internal\\nreflection.\\nWhen a ray of light enters from a denser medium to a rarer medium,\\nit bends away from the normal, for example, the ray AO1 B in Fig. 9.11.\\nThe incident ray AO1 is partially reflected (O1C) and partially transmitted\\n(O1B) or refracted, the angle of refraction (r) being larger than the angle of\\nincidence (i). As the angle of incidence increases, so does the angle of\\nFIGURE 9.10  Apparent depth for\\n(a) normal, and (b) oblique viewing.\\nFIGURE 9.9  Lateral shift of a ray refracted\\nthrough a parallel-sided slab.\\n2024-25'),\n",

The refracted ray is bent\\nso much away from the normal that it\\ngrazes the surface at the interface between\\nthe two media. This is shown by the ray\\nAO3 D in Fig. 9.11. If the angle of incidence\\nis increased still further (e.g., the ray AO4),\\nrefraction is not possible, and the incident\\nray is totally reflected. This is called total\\ninter nal r eflection . When light gets\\nreflected by a surface, normally some\\nfraction of it gets transmitted. The\\nreflected ray, therefore, is always less\\nintense than the incident ray, howsoever\\nsmooth the reflecting surface may be. In\\ntotal internal reflection, on the other hand,\\nno transmission of light takes place.\\nThe angle of incidence corresponding to an angle of refraction 90°,\\nsay ÐAO3N, is called the critical angle (ic ) for the given pair of media.   We\\nsee from Snell’s law [Eq. (9.10)] that if the relative refractive index of the\\nrefracting medium is less than one then, since the maximum value of sin\\nr is unity, there is an upper limit to the value of sin i for which the law\\ncan be satisfied, that is, i = ic such that\\nsin ic  = n21 (9.12)\\nFor values of  i larger than ic, Snell’s law of refraction cannot be\\nsatisfied, and hence no refraction is possible.\\nThe refractive index of denser medium 1 with respect to rarer medium\\n2 will be n12 = 1/sinic. Some typical critical angles are listed in Table 9.1.\\nFIGURE 9.11   Refraction and internal reflection\\nof rays from a point A in the denser medium\\n(water) incident at different angles at the interface\\nwith a rarer medium (air).\\nA demonstration for total inter nal reflection\\nAll optical phenomena can be demonstrated very easily with the use of a\\nlaser torch or pointer, which is easily available nowadays.

Do you find that it undergoes partial\\nreflection (which is seen as a spot on the table below) and partial refraction\\n[which comes out in the air and is seen as a spot on the roof; Fig. 9.12(a)]?\\nNow direct the laser beam from one side of the beaker such that it strikes\\nthe upper surface of water more obliquely [Fig. 9.12(b)]. Adjust the\\ndirection of laser beam until you find the angle for which the refraction\\nabove the water surface is totally absent and the beam is totally reflected\\nback to water.

Such a prism is also\\nused to invert images without chxanging their size [Fig. 9.13(c)].\\nIn the first two cases, the critical angle ic for the material of the prism\\nmust be less than 45°. We see from Table 9.1 that this is true for both\\ncrown glass and dense flint glass.\\n(ii) Optical fibres : Nowadays optical fibres are extensively used for\\ntransmitting audio and video signals through long distances. Optical\\nfibres too make use of the phenomenon of total internal reflection.\\nOptical fibres are fabricated with high quality composite glass/quartz\\nfibres. Each fibre consists of a core and\\ncladding. The refractive index of the\\nmaterial of the core is higher than that\\nof the cladding.\\nWhen a signal in the form of light is\\ndirected at one end of the fibre at a suitable\\nangle, it undergoes repeated total internal\\nreflections along the length of the fibre and\\nfinally comes out at the other end (Fig.\\n9.14). Since light undergoes total internal\\nreflection at each stage, there is no\\nappreciable loss in the intensity of the light\\nsignal. Optical fibres are fabricated such\\nthat light reflected at one side of inner\\nsurface strikes the other at an angle larger\\nthan the critical angle. Even if the fibre is\\nbent, light can easily travel along its length.\\nThus, an optical fibre can be used to act as\\nan optical pipe.\\nA bundle of optical fibres can be put to\\nseveral uses.

Obviously, optical\\nfibres can also be used for transmission of\\noptical signals. For example, these are used\\nas a ‘light pipe’ to facilitate visual examination\\nof internal organs like esophagus, stomach\\nand intestines. You might have seen a\\ncommonly available decorative lamp with fine\\nplastic fibres with their free ends forming a\\nfountain like structure. The other end of the\\nfibres is fixed over an electric lamp. When the\\nlamp is switched on, the light travels from the bottom of each fibre and\\nappears at the tip of its free end as a dot of light. The fibres in such\\ndecorative lamps are optical fibres.\\nThe main requirement in fabricating optical fibres is that there should\\nbe very little absorption of light as it travels for long distances inside\\nthem. This has been achieved by purification and special preparation of\\nmaterials such as quartz. In silica glass fibres, it is possible to transmit\\nmore than 95% of the light over a fibre length of 1 km. (Compare with\\nwhat you expect for a block of ordinary window glass 1 km thick.)\\n9.5 REFRACTION A\\nT SPHERICAL SURFACES\\nAND BY LENSES\\nWe have so far considered refraction at a plane interface. We shall now\\nconsider refraction at a spherical interface between two transparent media.\\nAn infinitesimal part of a spherical surface can be regarded as planar\\nand the same laws of refraction can be applied at every point on the\\nsurface. Just as for reflection by a spherical mirror, the normal at the\\npoint of incidence is perpendicular to the tangent plane to the spherical\\nsurface at that point and, therefore, passes through its centre of\\ncurvature. We first consider refraction by a single spherical surface and\\nfollow it by thin lenses. A thin lens is a transparent optical medium\\nbounded by two surfaces; at least one of which should be spherical.\\nApplying the formula for image formation by a single spherical surface\\nsuccessively at the two surfaces of a lens, we shall obtain the lens maker’s\\nformula and then the lens formula.\\n9.5.1  Refraction at a spherical surface\\nFigure 9.15 shows the geometry of formation of image I of an object O on\\nthe principal axis of a spherical surface with centre of curvature C, and\\nradius of curvature R. The rays are incident from a medium of refractive\\nindex n1, to another of refractive index n2. As before, we take the aperture\\n(or the lateral size) of the surface to be small compared to other distances\\ninvolved, so that small angle approximation can be made. In particular,\\nNM will be taken to be nearly equal to the length of the perpendicular\\nfrom the point N on the principal axis.

Though we derived\\nit for a real image formed by a convex lens, the formula is valid for both\\nconvex as well as concave lenses and for both real and virtual images.\\nIt is worth mentioning that the two foci, F and F¢, of a double convex\\nor concave lens are equidistant from the optical centre. The focus on the\\nside of the (original) source of light is called the first focal point, whereas\\nthe other is called the second focal point.\\nTo find the image of an object by a lens, we can, in principle, take any\\ntwo rays emanating from a point on an object; trace their paths using the\\nlaws of refraction and find the point where the refracted rays meet (or\\nappear to meet). In practice, however, it is convenient to choose any two\\nof the following rays:\\n(i)A ray emanating from the object parallel to the principal axis of the\\nlens after refraction passes through the second principal focus F¢ (in\\na convex lens) or appears to diverge (in a concave lens) from the first\\nprincipal focus F.\\n(ii) A ray of light, passing through the optical\\ncentre of the lens, emerges without any\\ndeviation after refraction.\\n(iii) (a) A ray of light passing through the first\\nprincipal focus of a convex lens [Fig. 9.17(a)]\\nemerges parallel to the principal axis after\\nrefraction.\\n(b) A ray of light incident on a concave lens\\nappearing to meet the principal axis at\\nsecond focus point emerges parallel to the\\nprincipal axis after refraction [Fig. 9.17(b)].\\nFigures 9.17(a) and (b) illustrate these rules\\nfor a convex and a concave  lens, respectively.\\nYou should practice drawing similar ray\\ndiagrams for different positions of the object with\\nrespect to the lens and also verify that the lens\\nformula, Eq.

All these rays will pass through the same\\nimage point after refraction at the lens.\\nMagnification ( m) produced by a lens is\\ndefined, like that for a mirror, as the ratio of the\\nsize of the image to that of the object.

Clearly, a lens of shorter focal length bends the incident\\nlight more,  while converging it in case of a convex lens\\nand diverging it in case of a concave lens. The power P of\\na lens is defined as the tangent of the angle by which it\\nconverges or diverges a beam of light parallel to the\\nprincipal axis falling at unit distance from the optical\\ncentre (Fig. 9.18).\\ntan ; , tanδ δ= = =h\\nf h fif 1 1\\n or \\n1\\nfδ =  for small\\nvalue of d. Thus,\\nP = \\n1\\nf (9.25)\\nThe SI unit for power of a lens is dioptre (D): 1D = 1m–1 . The power of\\na lens of focal length of 1 metre is one dioptre. Power of a lens is positive\\nfor a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens. Thus, when an\\noptician prescribes a corrective lens of power + 2.5 D, the required lens is\\na convex lens of focal length + 40 cm. A lens of power of – 4.0 D means a\\nconcave lens of focal length – 25 cm.\\nExample 9.7 (i) If f = 0.5 m for a glass lens, what is the power of the\\nlens?

Let the object\\nbe placed at a point O beyond the focus of the first\\nlens A (Fig. 9.19). The first lens produces an image\\nat I1. Since image I 1 is real, it serves as a virtual\\nobject for the second lens B, producing the final\\nimage at I. It must, however, be borne in mind that\\nformation of image by the first lens is presumed\\nonly to facilitate determination of the position of the\\nfinal image. In fact, the direction of rays emerging\\nfrom the first lens gets modified in accordance with\\nthe angle at which they strike the second lens. Since the lenses are thin,\\nwe assume the optical centres of the lenses to be coincident. Let this\\ncentral point be denoted by P.\\nFor the image formed by the first lens A, we get\\n1 1\\n1 1 1\\nv u f− = (9.27)\\nFor the image formed by the second lens B, we get\\n1 2\\n1 1 1\\nv v f− = (9.28)\\nAdding Eqs.

(9.32) is an algebraic sum of individual powers, so some of the terms\\non the right side may be positive (for convex lenses) and some negative\\n(for concave lenses). Combination of lenses helps to obtain diverging or\\nconverging lenses of desired magnification. It also enhances sharpness\\nof the image. Since the image formed by the first lens becomes the object\\nfor the second, Eq.

The angles of incidence\\nand refraction at the first face AB are i and r1,\\nwhile the angle of incidence (from glass to air) at\\nthe second face AC is r2 and the angle of refraction\\nor emergence e. The angle between the emergent\\nray RS and the direction of the incident ray PQ\\nis called the angle of deviation, \\nd.\\nIn the quadrilateral AQNR, two of the angles\\n(at the vertices Q and R) are right angles.\\nTherefore, the sum of the other angles of the\\nquadrilateral is 180°.\\nÐA + ÐQNR = 180°\\nFrom the triangle QNR,\\nr1 + r2 + ÐQNR = 180°\\nComparing these two equations, we get\\nr1 + r2 = A (9.34)\\nThe total deviation \\nd  is the sum of deviations at the two faces,\\nd = (i – r1 ) + (e – r 2 )\\nthat is,\\nd  = i + e – A (9.35)\\nThus, the angle of deviation depends on the angle of incidence. A plot\\nbetween the angle of deviation and angle of incidence is shown in\\nFig. 9.22.

Although the closest comfortable distance for viewing the image\\nis when it is at the near point (distance D @ 25 cm), it causes some strain\\non the eye.

The former clearly\\ndepends on the area of the objective. With larger diameters, fainter objects\\ncan be observed. The r\\nesolving power, or the ability to observe two objects\\ndistinctly, which are in very nearly the same direction, also depends on\\nthe diameter of the objective. So, the desirable aim in optical telescopes is\\nto make them with objective of large diameter. The largest lens objective\\nin use has a diameter of 40 inch (~1.02 m). It is at the Yerkes Observatory\\nin Wisconsin, USA. Such big lenses tend to be very heavy and therefore,\\ndifficult to make and support by their edges. Further, it is rather difficult\\nand expensive to make such large sized lenses which form images that\\nare free from any kind of chromatic aberration and distortions.\\nFor these reasons, modern telescopes use a concave mirror rather\\nthan a lens for the objective. Telescopes with mirror objectives are called\\nreflecting telescopes. Ther e is no chr omatic aberration in a mirr or.\\nMechanical support is much less of a problem since a mirror weighs\\nmuch less than a lens of equivalent optical quality, and can be supported\\nover its entire back surface, not just over its rim. One obvious problem\\nwith a reflecting telescope is that the objective mirror focusses light inside\\n2024-25'),\n",

Reflection is governed by the equation Ði = Ðr¢  and refraction by the\\nSnell’s law, sini/sinr = n, where the incident ray, reflected ray, refracted\\nray and normal lie in the same plane. Angles of incidence, reflection\\nand refraction are i, r ¢ and r, respectively.\\n2. The critical angle of incidence ic for a ray incident from a denser to rarer\\nmedium, is that angle for which the angle of refraction is 90°. For\\ni > ic, total internal reflection occurs. Multiple internal reflections in\\ndiamond (ic  @ 24.4°), totally reflecting prisms and mirage, are some\\nexamples of total internal reflection. Optical fibres consist of glass\\nfibres coated with a thin layer of material of lower refractive index.\\nLight incident at an angle at one end comes out at the other , after\\nmultiple internal reflections, even if the fibre is bent.\\nFIGURE 9.26  Schematic diagram of a reflecting telescope (Cassegrain).\\nthe telescope tube. One must have an eyepiece and the observer right\\nthere, obstructing some light (depending on the size of the observer cage).\\nThis is what is done in the very large 200 inch (~5.08 m) diameters, Mt.\\nPalomar telescope, California. The viewer sits near the focal point of the\\nmirror, in a small cage. Another solution to the problem is to deflect the\\nlight being focussed by another mirror. One such arrangement using a\\nconvex secondary mirror to focus the incident light, which now passes\\nthrough a hole in the objective primary mirr or, is shown in Fig. 9.26.\\nThis is known as a Cassegrain telescope, after its inventor. It has the\\nadvantages of a large focal length in a short telescope. The largest telescope\\nin India is in Kavalur, Tamil Nadu. It is a 2.34 m diameter r eflecting\\ntelescope (Cassegrain).

The laws of reflection and refraction are true for all surfaces and\\npairs of media at the point of the incidence.\\n2. The real image of an object placed between f and 2f from a convex lens\\ncan be seen on a screen placed at the image location. If the screen is\\nremoved, is the image still there?  This question puzzles many, because\\nit is difficult to reconcile ourselves with an image suspended in air\\nwithout a screen. But the image does exist. Rays from a given point\\non the object are converging to an image point in space and diverging\\naway. The screen simply diffuses these rays, some of which reach our\\neye and we see the image. This can be seen by the images formed in\\nair during a laser show.\\n3. Image formation needs regular reflection/refraction. In principle, all\\nrays from a given point should reach the same image point. This is\\nwhy you do not see your image by an irregular reflecting object, say\\nthe page of a book.\\n4. Thick lenses give coloured images due to dispersion. The variety in\\ncolour of objects we see around us is due to the constituent colours\\nof the light incident on them. A monochromatic light may produce an\\nentirely different perception about the colours on an object as seen in\\nwhite light.\\n5. For a simple microscope, the angular size of the object equals the\\nangular size of the image. Yet it offers magnification because we can\\nkeep the small object much closer to the eye than 25 cm and hence\\nhave it subtend a large angle. The image is at 25 cm which we can see.\\nWithout the microscope, you would need to keep the small object at\\n25 cm which would subtend a very small angle.\\n8. Magnifying power m of a simple microscope is given by m = 1 + (D/f),\\nwhere D = 25 cm is the least distance of distinct vision and f is the\\nfocal length of the convex lens. If the image is at infinity, m = D/f. For\\na compound microscope, the magnifying power is given by m = me × m0\\nwhere me = 1 + (D/fe), is the magnification due to the eyepiece and mo\\nis the magnification produced by the objective. Approximately,\\no e\\nL Dm f f= ×\\nwhere fo and fe are the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece,\\nrespectively, and L is the distance between their focal points.\\n9. Magnifying power m of a telescope is the ratio of the angle b subtended\\nat the eye by the image to the angle a subtended at the eye by the\\nobject.\\no\\ne\\nfm f\\nβ\\nα= =\\nwhere f0 and fe are the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece,\\nrespectively.\\n2024-25'),\n",

The refracted ray is bent\\nso much away from the normal that it\\ngrazes the surface at the interface between\\nthe two media. This is shown by the ray\\nAO3 D in Fig. 9.11. If the angle of incidence\\nis increased still further (e.g., the ray AO4),\\nrefraction is not possible, and the incident\\nray is totally reflected. This is called total\\ninter nal r eflection . When light gets\\nreflected by a surface, normally some\\nfraction of it gets transmitted. The\\nreflected ray, therefore, is always less\\nintense than the incident ray, howsoever\\nsmooth the reflecting surface may be. In\\ntotal internal reflection, on the other hand,\\nno transmission of light takes place.\\nThe angle of incidence corresponding to an angle of refraction 90°,\\nsay ÐAO3N, is called the critical angle (ic ) for the given pair of media.   We\\nsee from Snell’s law [Eq. (9.10)] that if the relative refractive index of the\\nrefracting medium is less than one then, since the maximum value of sin\\nr is unity, there is an upper limit to the value of sin i for which the law\\ncan be satisfied, that is, i = ic such that\\nsin ic  = n21 (9.12)\\nFor values of  i larger than ic, Snell’s law of refraction cannot be\\nsatisfied, and hence no refraction is possible.\\nThe refractive index of denser medium 1 with respect to rarer medium\\n2 will be n12 = 1/sinic.

The path is called a ray of light, and a bundle of such rays\\nconstitutes a beam of light.\\nIn this chapter, we consider the phenomena of reflection, refraction\\nand dispersion of light, using the ray picture of light. Using the basic\\nlaws of reflection and refraction, we shall study the image formation by\\nplane and spherical reflecting and refracting surfaces. We then go on to\\ndescribe the construction and working of some important optical\\ninstruments, including the human eye.\\n9.2  REFLECTION OF LIGHT BY SPHERICAL MIRRORS\\nWe are familiar with the laws of r eflection. The\\nangle of reflection (i.e., the angle between reflected\\nray and the normal to the reflecting surface or\\nthe mirror) equals the angle of incidence (angle\\nbetween incident ray and the normal). Also that\\nthe incident ray, reflected ray and the normal to\\nthe reflecting surface at the point of incidence lie\\nin the same plane (Fig. 9.1). These laws are valid\\nat each point on any reflecting surface whether\\nplane or curved. However, we shall r estrict our\\ndiscussion to the special case of curved surfaces,\\nthat is, spherical surfaces. The normal in this case\\nis to be taken as normal to the tangent to surface\\nat the point of incidence. That is, the normal is\\nalong the radius, the line joining the centre of curvature of the mirror to\\nthe point of incidence.\\nWe have already studied that the geometric centre of a spherical mirror\\nis called its pole while that of a spherical lens is called its optical centre.\\nThe line joining the pole and the centre of curvature of the spherical\\nmirror is known as the principal axis. In the case of spherical lenses, the\\nprincipal axis is the line joining the optical centre with its principal focus\\nas you will see later.\\n9.2.1  Sign convention\\nTo derive the relevant formulae for\\nreflection by spherical mirrors and\\nrefraction by spherical lenses, we must\\nfirst adopt a sign convention for\\nmeasuring distances. In this book, we\\nshall follow the Cartesian sign\\nconvention . According to this\\nconvention, all distances are measured\\nfrom the pole of the mirror or the optical\\ncentre of the lens. The distances\\nmeasured in the same direction as the\\nincident light are taken as positive and\\nthose measured in the direction\\nopposite to the direction of incident light are taken as negative (Fig. 9.2).\\nThe heights measured upwards with respect to x-axis and normal to the\\n2024-25'),\n",
